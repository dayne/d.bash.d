# d.bash.d


A technique for handling a .bash.d folder and some optional helper scripts to go
with it.

## usage

(TODO)

## install

```
cd projects
git clone git@github.com/dayne/d.bash.d
cd d.bash.d
./install.sh
```

The installer is as simple as:

```
cat d.bashrc.sh >> ~/.bashrc
mkdir ~/.bash.d/
```

Optional script setup with links:
Either copy bash.d script to .bash.d or use links if you want to hack on them
together
